# Unsupervised-Learning--Customer-Segmentation

> This project is part of the Udacity course on Machine learning - Unsupervised learning.I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. The segments could then be used for targetted direct marketing campaigns. The data was provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics. 

### Project outline 

1. Data Wrangling - dealing with missing data, outliers, categorical variables,  
2. Feature scaling -StandardScaler
3. Dimensionality Reduction - SKlearn's PCA
4. Interpreting principal components
5. K-means clustering on the PCA-transformed data
6. Applying the steps on a different dataset (general population)

### Libraries used
1. sklearn classes - Kmeans, PCA, Imputer, StandardScaler
2. numpy
3. pandas
4. matplotlib
5. seaborn

### Files

1. Jupyter notebook of the project
2. HTML file of the same project
